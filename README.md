# Project Name

URL Shortener Application

## Description

In todayâ€™s digital world, where long URLs can be cumbersome and difficult to share, URL shorteners have become a popular solution. This project aims to build a URL shortener application using Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL.

URL shorteners are web applications that take long URLs as input and generate shorter, more compact URLs as output. These shortened URLs redirect users to the original long URLs when accessed. They are commonly used in various scenarios, such as social media sharing, email marketing campaigns, and tracking link clicks.

This project consists of a full-stack application with a frontend developed in React and a backend developed in Spring Boot. The frontend allows users to enter a long URL and create a corresponding short URL. The backend handles the URL creation and retrieval operations, storing the data in a PostgreSQL database.

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL

## Components

#### Methods

- `handleInputChange`: Updates the `inUrl` state based on the input field value.
- `handleSubmit`: Handles the form submission, sends a POST request to create a new URL, and fetches the updated URL list.
- `fetchUrls`: Fetches the list of URLs from the server and updates the `urls` state.
- `useEffect`: Calls `fetchUrls` once when the component is mounted.
